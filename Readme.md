# LangChain Learning (Personal)

Lightweight repo for personal experiments with LangChain (prompts, chains, RAG, tools/agents, and evals).

## Goals
- Learn core LangChain patterns with small, focused examples
- Build reusable snippets for personal use cases (notes search, Q&A, utilities)
- Keep setup simple and portable
